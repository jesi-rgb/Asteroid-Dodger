# Asteroid Dodger

Little game made in Unity just to try the environment out. Move with arrows and shoot with spacebar.

Every aspect of the game was crafted by me (music, pixel art, post processing and, of course, coding). The idea and code references mainly come from <a href="https://github.com/SebLague">Sebastian Lage</a>, an amazing programmer and overall artist.

To see the code, just go to Assets/scripts, and search for the .cs files. 

Finally, if you want to play the game: <a href="https://tinyurl.com/AsteroidDodger">Asteroid Dodger</a>
